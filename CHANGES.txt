This file briefly records the important changes that affect the DB schema, and the steps to upgrade the DB.


*** 20181203 ***:

Changes were made to DB schema. In comparison with V1.x, two new apps were added to orgnize the structure: resources and xcalib. To upgrade from 1.x, changes below should be manually applied to the DB:

Rename machine, filter, cone, chamber, electrometer, doctor to resources_***
Rename measuremenetset, outputfactor, calibration to calib_***
Make changes to django_content_type table to match the changes above.

Commands: 

sqlite3 sxt.db
.tables
alter table a rename to table b;
update django_content_type set app_label='resources' where id='8'

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate --fake

For this step, code is tagged as: Apps_resources_xcalib_added.


*** 20181205 ***

Lots of problems in changing the schema. Hence will break the migration path 
from 1.x series to create a new schema.
